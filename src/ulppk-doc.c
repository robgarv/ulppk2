 *
 * <h1>Introduction</h1>
 * The Unix/Linux Process Programming Kit (ULPPK --- hey I had to call it something)
 * is implemented as a shared library of C functions. These functions provide in
 * memory and memory mapped (persistent) data structure support, logging and
 * diagnostics, process control, socket communications, and other tools. These tools
 * provide a lightweight framework that supports rapid assembly of systems of
 * communicating processes. 
 *
 * The package ulppk-demo provides a simple demonstration system consisting of 
 * a command line client, a socket server, and a state machine process. The client sends
 * events to the socket server which dispatches them to the state machine process
 * via memory mapped message queue. 
 *
 * <h1>Background</h1>
 * ulppk is a packaging of a collection of re-used functions developed by the author (moi)
 * beginning in 1989. These functions were written to solve programming problems which
 * were recurring in systems development. Many of these functions were originally developed
 * for use in real time embedded applications and later ported to *nix systems.
 *
 * Over the years, a rather large but fairly disorganized "bag of tricks" had been
 * developed and carried from job to job. Extending and polishing the collection became
 * something of a hobby.
 *
 * ulppk packages the best and most frequently used items in this bag of tricks in
 * what is hopefully a coherent form. There are some rough edges ... particularly
 * with logging and certain aspects of ini file (program settings file) handling.
 * ulppk_log.c is useful but applications might well prefer to use other logging
 * applications which are more robust. Unfortunately, in its current state the library
 * itself has to use ulppk_log.c for logging. (I'm working on a "log provider" suite
 * to insulate the library code from the details of logging mechanisms but that
 * is still in the early stages of design.)
 *
 * Probably the most useful components of the library are the memory mapped I/O
 * modules and the state machine module. The state machine module offers a very
 * light weight facility for defining event driven processes modeled with Ward/Mellor
 * state transition diagrams. For many applications, this is rather much like
 * swatting a fly with a howitzer ... but if your analysis winds up defining more than
 * a dozen states and multiple transitions between states, this offers an implementation
 * that is far more manageable than the typical nested switch statement approach.
 *
 * Anyone who has read "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" will recognize
 * the influence of the late W. Richard Stevens on this code. But then, almost everyone who
 * has programmed in the Unix/Linux environment remains indebted to Stevens. He
 * influenced us all.
