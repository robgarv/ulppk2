Unix/Linux Process Programming Kit

A collection of facilities that support the development of systems
of interacting processes. The package includes a shared library of
functions, supporting programs, and test programs.

Build Instructions

For development: 

aclocal
autoconf
automake

Then run configure. There are a few different ways to do that. 


CONFIGURATION

There are several options for configuring the build system. 

The basic method is the classic configure script ... use
this for production builds. 

./configure

For enabling debugging and debug features:

./config4debug logging

(Note: runconfigure.sh is deprecated.)

Note this will cause a lot of logging to happen and
if you haven't set up system logging that will show up
on your screen. 

./config4debug 

Just enables gdb debugging without all the extra logging

To debug a program built under the src directory:

libtool --mode=execute gdb programname

To build and run tests (run from project root directory)

make check

To make a distribution package:

make dist

To install

sudo make install

To remove 

sudo make uninstall

To regenerate the documentation

doxygen doxygen.conf
