/**
 * @file mmdeque.h
 *
 * @brief A generalized memory mapped double ended queue.  The queue is implemented
 * on top of a memory map atom ... typically a memory mapped file.
 * 
 * The package reads the environment variable MMDQ_DIR_PATH. This should
 * be the directory that will contain the deque files. If you are using
 * sysconfig.c and ini file support (ifile.c) then this environment variable
 * can be overridden by inifile settings.
