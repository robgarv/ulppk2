/**
 * @file mmpool.c
 * 
 * @brief Memory Mapped Buffer Pool Management.
 * 
 * This package defines a persistent buffer pool. Buffers are mapped to
 * disk files through the mmfor, mmapfile and mmatom mechanisms.
 * 
 * A buffer pool consists of the following objects
 * 
 * 1) A BUFFER POOL MANAGEMENT FILE (BPMF). This contains control
 *    structures necessary to manage the allocation and deallocation
 *    of buffers.
 * 2) A BUFFER POOL CONTENTS FILE (BPCF). This is a file of fixed
 *    length buffers (records).
 * 
 * Both kinds of files are managed as memory mapped files.
 * 
 * The BPMF consists of two deque headers (see dqacc.h) and an array
 * of deque items. Deque items are indices of buffers in the contents
 * (BPCF) file. The two deque headers represent two sets of buffers. The
 * first set contains the buffers "in the pool", which are available for use.
 * This is called the "in deque", dq_inpool. The second set are the buffers
 * which have been allocated for use and are therefore "out of the pool".
 * This set is called the "out deque", dq_outpool.
 * 
 * Each buffer in the BPCF file consists of a short control header
 * and user specifed data.
 *
 * Manages pools of memory mapped fixed length records.
 *
 * BPMF == Buffer Pool Management Files. Contains information used to
 * manage the state of the buffer pool. This structure contains two double
 * ended queues (deques). One deque contains buffer pool indices of those
 * buffers which have not been allocated and are hence "in the pool". The
 * other contains indices of those blocks have have been allocated and are
 * hence "out of the pool" and presumably being used by processes.
 *
 * BPCF == Buffer Pool Content Files ... contains the actual buffers, an
 * array of fixed length memory blocks.
