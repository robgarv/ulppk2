 *
 * A "message cell" is a simple construct that facilitates inter process communications.
 * A data object is logically associated with a POSIX semaphore. The data object is
 * normally a memory mapped (an mmatom construct), so it can be safely accessed by multiple
 * processes.
 *
 * A server process receives data through the data object. When it wants to
 * receive data, the process calls msgcell_rcv, passing a check function.
 * The check function checks the data object and if new data is present the call
 * returns immediately. Otherwise, the calling process is blocked on a sem_wait.
 *
 * A client process writes data into the data object and calls msgcell_xmt to signal
 * delivery of data. msgcell_xmt calls sem_post to signal a pending server process.
 *
 * This package makes no assumptions about the type or access methods of the data
 * object. The calling application is responsible for creating/opening the data object,
 * and closing it properly when access is no longer required.
 *
 * Data check functions, of course, incorporate knowledge of the data object and
 * its access methods. These functions accept a single void* as input and return
 * an int. A return of 0 (MSGCELL_NODATA_AVAIL) means no data available ... a return of
 * 1 (MSGCELL_DATA_AVAIL) means data is available.
