/**
 * @file linearlist.h
 *
 * @brief Generalized linear list functions.
 *
 *	A linear list is a memory mapped file of records which are
 *	managed in a fashion that support addition and deletion. It
 *	is presumed that the records are of equal size.
 *
 *      A linear list is implemented on top of an mmfor file.
 *      The first record in the mmfor file (index 0) is the control record.
 *
 *      Addition to the list is accomplished by writing to the record
 *      at index nextx and incrementing nextx. Deletion is accomplished
 *      by copying the record at nextx-1 to the record being deleted
 *      and decrementing nextx.
 *
 *      Consequently, deletion will cause ordering of the records
 *      in the list to change (unless the record being deleted is at the
 *      end of the list.)
