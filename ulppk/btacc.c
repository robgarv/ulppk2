/**
 * @file btacc.c
 * @brief Binary Tree Access: btacc .

    This package provides facilities for manipulating binary trees. Records
    of arbitray form and content may be added, searched for, or removed from
    binary trees by this package.

    The following is a summary of user callable routines:
<ul>
    <li>bt_add : add node to binary tree</li>
    <li>bt_del : delete node from binary tree</li>
	<li>bt_search: search binary tree based on</li>
    <li>bt_leftmost: return pointer to left most node of tree</li>
    <li>bt_rightmost: return pointer to right most node of tree</li>
    <li>bt_inorder: In order traversal of the binary tree executing an action on
    	each node visited</li>
    <li>bt_replace: Use with caution. Replace a node in a binary tree with a new node.
    	This is a raw replace: It is up to the caller to insure that the
    	ordering of the tree is not violated. (That is, the value of the
    	old node must be consistent in sort order with the value of the new node).
    	If this constraint is unacceptable or infeasible, simply do a bt_del of
    	the old node followed by a bt_add of the new.
    </li>
</ul>
    User supplied comparison routines are supplied to bt_add and bt_search.
    These routines obey the following call convention:

    result = function(tree_node,arglist);

    Where:

            ushort result [return value] is a result code:
<ul>
            <li>-1 => current tree node has key less than record key</li>
            <li>0 => current tree node has key equal to current record key</li>
            <li>1 => current tree node has key greater than current record key</li>
</ul>
        TREE_NODE tree [input] is a pointer to a tree node.

        void* arglist [input] is a pointer to a user defined argument record.

 * @brief Search through Binary Tree --- bt_search.

    The function bt_add adds nodes to the tree based on an insertion key.
    (The insertion key and its comparison operations are expressed in the
    comparison function passed to bt_add.) Thus, the tree is sorted on insertion
    key. The function bt_search provides the means by which the tree may be
    searched for a node with insertion key matching user defined criteria.
    (See bt_inorder for a method by which the tree may be scanned for
    nodes based on other data fields than the insertion key.)

    This function provides an engine by which the user may conduct searches
    for nodes matching specific criteria through the binary tree. The caller
    provides a user defined comparison function, as described above in the
    discussion of bt_add. The return codes from this comparison
    function are employed as follows:
<ul>
        <li>-1 => travel down left subtree of current node</li>
        <li>0 => search criteria match ... return pointer to matching node</li>
        <li>1 => travel down right subtree of current node</li>
</ul>

   @param tree is a pointer to a tree node.

   @param criteria is a pointer to a user defined record containing
            match criteria, which is interpreted by the user defined comparison
            function.

   @param compare_function is a
            pointer to a match function.
   @return matchnode is a pointer to a node matching
            the user defined criteria. A value of NULL indicates that no

/**
 * @brief Inorder Traversal of Binary Tree --- bt_inorder.

    This function performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree. At each node visited,
    the user supplied action function is called. The calling format of the action function
    is given by:

        flag = action(PTREE_NODE tree,void* argbuff);

        Where

			ushort flag [return value] is TRUE if the traversal is to continue
                and FALSE otherwise.

            PTREE_NODE tree [input] is a pointer to the node being visited.
    
            void* argbuff [input] is a user defined record interpreted by the
                action function.

    The function bt_inorder can thus be used to visit and process each node of
    a tree, or to search for a matching data field other than the insertion key.
    (Since a binary tree is sorted on its insertion key, one would use bt_search
    to search for an insertion key of a given value or within a range of values.)

    lastnode = bt_inorder(tree,argbuff,action);



 * @param tree is a pointer to a tree node/ the branch to be searched

 * @param argbuff is a pointer to the user defined argument record
            for the action function.

 * @param action is a pointer
            to the user defined action function.

 * @return A pointer to the last node visited during the inorder traversal.
 * 	Note that if this pointeris NULL on return, the entire tree was traversed
 * 	WITHOUT the action routine ever indicating a termination condition.

 * @brief Replace binary tree node --- bt_replace.

    This function replaces a node of the binary tree with a new node.
    The disposition of the displaced node is the responsibility of the
    caller. The caller is also required to insure that the search key
    of the replaced node is consistent with that of the new one, so that
    the tree doesn't suddenly become unsorted.
